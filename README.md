## Project Title: Image Processing and Color Channel Manipulation with Python

### * Project Description:
In this project:

##### 1.Image Loading and Conversion:
A flower image is loaded using the Pillow library and converted into a NumPy array for processing.
##### 2. Channel Extraction and Manipulation: 
The individual color channels (red, green, and blue) of the image are extracted. Modifications are made to isolate the red channel by setting the green and 
blue channels to zero.
##### 3.Visualization:
The image and its manipulated channels are visualized using Matplotlib with different color mappings (such as 'gray', 'Purples', and 'Blues') to demonstrate 
the effects of changes made to the image.
##### 4.Array Operations: 
Basic operations are performed on arrays to modify image data, such as multiplying an array by a constant and setting specific values to zero.

### Responsibilities:
##### * Image Loading: 
Open and load the image using the Pillow library and convert it into a NumPy array for manipulation.
##### * Color Channel Manipulation: 
Isolate and modify specific color channels (e.g., by setting green and blue channels to zero to focus on the red channel).
##### * Visualization:
Display the original and manipulated images using Matplotlib, experimenting with different color maps to highlight specific channels.
##### * Array Operations: 
Perform mathematical operations on arrays such as multiplying by constants and altering specific elements of the image.
