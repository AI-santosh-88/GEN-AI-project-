## Project Title: Image Processing and Color Channel Manipulation with Python

### * Project Description:
In this project:

##### 1.Image Loading and Conversion:
A flower image is loaded using the Pillow library and converted into a NumPy array for processing.
##### 2. Channel Extraction and Manipulation: 
The individual color channels (red, green, and blue) of the image are extracted. Modifications are made to isolate the red channel by setting the green and 
blue channels to zero.
##### 3.Visualization:
The image and its manipulated channels are visualized using Matplotlib with different color mappings (such as 'gray', 'Purples', and 'Blues') to demonstrate 
the effects of changes made to the image.
##### 4.Array Operations: 
Basic operations are performed on arrays to modify image data, such as multiplying an array by a constant and setting specific values to zero.

### Responsibilities:
##### * Image Loading: 
Open and load the image using the Pillow library and convert it into a NumPy array for manipulation.
##### * Color Channel Manipulation: 
Isolate and modify specific color channels (e.g., by setting green and blue channels to zero to focus on the red channel).
##### * Visualization:
Display the original and manipulated images using Matplotlib, experimenting with different color maps to highlight specific channels.
##### * Array Operations: 
Perform mathematical operations on arrays such as multiplying by constants and altering specific elements of the image.

### Tools Used:
##### 1.NumPy: 
Used for array creation and manipulation of image data as matrices.
##### 2.Pillow (PIL): 
Used for opening, reading, and converting images into NumPy arrays for processing.
##### 3.Matplotlib: 
Used for visualizing the image and the effects of modifications on different color channels.

### Project Summary:
This project demonstrates basic image processing techniques using Python. It focuses on manipulating an image's color channels (red, green, and blue) and visualizing the effects of those manipulations. The project utilizes NumPy, Pillow, and Matplotlib to load, process, and visualize an image. Specific operations include isolating and modifying individual color channels, visualizing the resulting images, and performing basic array operations such as multiplying and setting specific channels to zero.
